# blueimp-gallery-backend

An ultra-lightweight, (nearly) databaseless Django and Python 3 backend for
[Blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery).

Blueimp Gallery is a CSS/JS/HTML frontend for photo galleries. This is a
backend dealing with petty templating, etc. to transform Blueimp Gallery into
something easily useable out-of-the-box.

It directly uses a file arborescence, recursively scanned, to find pictures to
display.
